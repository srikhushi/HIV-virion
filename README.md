# HIV-virion


Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) continues to be a disease that 
kills thousands of individuals each year Through the dedicated use of computer vision frameworks and machine 
learning techniques, we have developed an optimized low-computational-cost 8-layer 
convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone capable of classifying HIV-1 virions 
at various stages of maturity and morphogenesis. The dataset including TEM images 
of HIV-1 viral life cycle phases is analysed and augmented through various 
techniques to make the framework robust in real-time. The CNN layers then extract 
pertinent disease traits from TEM images and utilise them to provide diagnostic 
predictions.It was discovered that the framework performed with an accuracy of 99.76% 
on the training set, 85.83% on the validation set, and 91.33% on the test set, after 
being trained on a wide range of micrographs which comprised of different 
experimental samples and magnifications.
